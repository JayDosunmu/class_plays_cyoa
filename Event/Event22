You wake up in a field. A man in a red hat stands over you. A man you know to be Wedge. He reaches his hand out to you. You jump up with a start, "Hello Wedge, I'm back.", to which he replies, "Oh good, I know you say to just kill you until you loop through enough to regain your memory, but that was getting old. We really need a better plan for dealing with killing immortals."
